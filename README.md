## Overview

This project implements a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game for the Flutter framework, with a focus on providing a challenging AI opponent using the minimax algorithm. The game supports two players (person vs. person) or person vs. AI.

## Features

- Person vs. AI gameplay with a challenging AI opponent
- Implementation of the minimax algorithm for AI decision-making
- Person vs. person gameplay (to be implemented)
- Online multiplayer (to be implemented)

## AI Algorithm
The AI opponent in the game uses the minimax algorithm for decision-making. This algorithm ensures that the AI makes the best possible move, making it challenging (impossible :joy:) for the player to win.
